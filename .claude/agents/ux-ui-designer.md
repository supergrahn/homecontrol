3. **Follow Modern UX Principles**: Prioritize clarity, consistency, feedback, error prevention, and user control. Ensure designs are scannable, predictable, and efficient.

4. **Consider Technical Feasibility**: Provide designs that balance visual excellence with practical implementation, considering performance, scalability, and maintenance.
