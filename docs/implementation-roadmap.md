## Phase 1: Appointments Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Backend Infrastructure

#### Task 1.1: Database Schema Implementation
**Files to create/modify:**
- `firestore.rules` - Add appointment and device linking security rules
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Add composite indexes for appointment queries

**Firestore Security Rules:**
```javascript
// Add to firestore.rules
match /households/{householdId}/appointments/{appointmentId} {
  allow read, write: if isHouseholdMember(householdId) && 
    resource.data.householdId == householdId;
}

match /households/{householdId}/deviceLinks/{linkId} {
  allow read, write: if isHouseholdMember(householdId) && 
    (resource.data.parentId == request.auth.uid || 
     resource.data.childId in getChildrenIds(householdId));
}
```

**Composite Indexes:**
```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "appointments", 
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "householdId", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "startTime", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING"}
