## Accessibility & Localization

### Norwegian Language Considerations

#### Linguistic Features
- **Bokmål vs Nynorsk**: Default to Bokmål, allow preference selection
- **Informal vs Formal**: Use informal "du" form for parent communication
- **Regional variations**: Support for major dialects in voice features
- **English integration**: Seamless switching for international families

#### Cultural Communication Patterns
- **Directness**: Clear, straightforward messaging without excessive politeness
- **Consensus building**: Language that supports group decision-making
- **Modesty (janteloven)**: Avoid overly promotional language
- **Inclusivity**: Gender-neutral language for all family structures

### Accessibility Standards

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Color contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum ratio for all Norwegian cultural colors
- **Touch targets**: 44dp minimum for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader support**: VoiceOver/TalkBack with Norwegian pronunciation
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full app navigable without touch

#### Norwegian Accessibility Considerations
- **Seasonal Affective Disorder**: High contrast modes for dark winter months
- **Multilingual families**: Easy language switching within app
- **Age diversity**: Support for grandparents and older family members
- **Rural connectivity**: Offline mode for areas with poor cell coverage

### Localization Requirements

#### Date and Time Formatting
```typescript
// Norwegian date/time patterns
const norwegianFormats = {
  date: "dd.MM.yyyy",        // 17.05.2025
  time: "HH:mm",             // 14:30
  dateTime: "dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm", // 17.05.2025 14:30
  dayOfWeek: "dddd",         // "mandag"
  monthYear: "MMMM yyyy"     // "mai 2025"
};
```

#### Currency and Numbers
```typescript
// Norwegian localization
const norwegianFormats = {
  currency: "NOK",           // Norwegian kroner
  numberFormat: "nb-NO",     // Norwegian number formatting (space as thousands separator)
  currencySymbol: "kr",      // Currency display
  priceFormat: "### kr"      // 250 kr
};
```

#### Cultural Event Names
- Maintain Norwegian names for cultural events (not translated)
- Provide cultural context in parentheses for international families
- Support for both Norwegian and English event descriptions

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Real-time Updates and Notifications

#### Norwegian Communication Etiquette
```typescript
interface NotificationRules {
  quietHours: {
    start: "20:00";
    end: "07:00";
    deferNonUrgent: true;
  };
  
  schoolCommunication: {
    respectTeacherHours: true;
    batchNonUrgent: true;
    highlightUrgent: true;
  };
  
  culturalSensitivity: {
    pauseOnNationalHolidays: true;
    reduceFrequencyInSummer: true;
    respiteWeekends: true;
  };
}
```

#### Real-time Coordination Patterns
- **Live RSVP updates** with Norwegian politeness ("Takk for at du kommer!")
- **Weather-triggered notifications** for outdoor events
- **Last-minute changes** with appropriate urgency levels
- **Dugnad volunteer coordination** with peer encouragement

### Community Coordination Interfaces

#### Democratic Decision Making
```typescript
interface DecisionMaking {
  votingStyle: "consensus" | "majority" | "admin";
  discussionPeriod: Duration;
  anonymousVoting: boolean;
  norwegianConsensusRules: {
    allowObjections: true;
    seekCompromise: true;
    respectMinorities: true;
  };
}
```

#### Resource Sharing Marketplace
- **Equipment lending** (ski equipment, birthday party supplies)
- **Carpool coordination** with school pickup integration
- **Meal coordination** for events and dugnad
- **Skill sharing** (language exchange, homework help)

### Norwegian Cultural Event Templates UI

#### Template Selection Interface
```typescript
interface TemplateCard {
  culturalSignificance: string;
  timingRecommendations: string[];
  weatherConsiderations: string[];
  traditionalElements: string[];
  planningSuggestions: string[];
  difficultyLevel: "enkelt" | "middels" | "avansert";
}
```

#### Progressive Event Building
- **Step 1**: Cultural context and significance
- **Step 2**: Timing with Norwegian considerations
- **Step 3**: Guest management with school integration
- **Step 4**: Activity planning with traditional elements
- **Step 5**: Logistics with weather backup
- **Step 6**: Communication setup with cultural appropriateness

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management Integration

#### Extending Existing Patterns
The Groups and Events features should integrate with the existing TanStack React Query patterns:

```typescript
// Query patterns for community features
const communityQueries = {
  groups: ["groups", householdId, userId],
  groupDetail: ["group", groupId],
  groupEvents: ["group", groupId, "events"],
  communityEvents: ["events", "community", { location, date }],
  schoolEvents: ["events", "school", schoolId],
  norwegianHolidays: ["calendar", "norwegian-holidays", year]
};
```

#### Norwegian-Specific Context Providers
```typescript
interface NorwegianCommunityContext {
  currentSeason: Season;
  schoolContext: SchoolContext;
  respectsQuietHours: boolean;
  culturalPreferences: CulturalPreferences;
  weatherIntegration: WeatherContext;
}
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Offline-First Community Features
- **Cached group membership** for offline access
- **Local event storage** with sync when online
- **Optimistic updates** for RSVP and group interactions
- **Background sync** for community updates

#### Norwegian-Specific Optimizations
- **Weather API caching** for event planning
- **School calendar prefetching** for semester planning
- **Cultural event templates** bundled with app
- **Translation caching** for Norwegian/English switching

### Integration Points

#### Existing Feature Integration
- **Calendar synchronization** with new community events
- **Household task coordination** with group activities
- **Child management** with group age restrictions
- **Settings integration** for cultural preferences

#### External Norwegian Services
- **Weather API** (yr.no integration preferred)
- **School system APIs** where available
- **Norwegian holiday calendar** (official government calendar)
- **Vipps payment integration** for event costs
